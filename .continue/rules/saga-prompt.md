Referencing and modifying `src/types/saga.d.ts`, help me develop a data model for a DnD campaign.

The data model should reflect storytelling but not rule mechanics.

Campaigns will be composed of parts, parts will be composed of sessions. 

A DM will use this tool to create a SessionPlan. This is the plan of what will happen in a session. It will have a list of events, encounters, etc..

After a session has run the DM will create a SessionSummary, which will be a list of points of things that happened in the session.
